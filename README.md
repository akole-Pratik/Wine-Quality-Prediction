# Wine-Quality-Prediction

# About
The quality of a wine is important for the consumers as well as the wine industry. The traditional (expert) way of measuring wine quality is time-consuming. Nowadays, machine learning models are important tools to replace human tasks. In this case, there are several features to predict the wine quality but the entire features will not be relevant for better prediction. So, our thesis work is focusing on what wine features are important to get the promising result.
